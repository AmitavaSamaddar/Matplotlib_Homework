Observations:

In order of popularity, Urban areas is most popular in ride share followed by Suburban and Rural.  For Fares and Rides, nearly two third of the market share is from Urban area.  And four fifth of total drivers are from Urban area.

More drivers in Urban area resulting in less average income per driver in Urban area.  In the same way, a Rural driver gets more average ride than an Urban driver.  Actually, on average a Rural driver is getting 2.4 times rides and 3.4 times fare than an Urban driver.

From a passenger perspective, it's always better chance to get a ride share in Urban area (as there are more drivers) and pay relatively less for the journey (fare/ride ratio is higer in Rural areas for less number of drivers).

Following chart is to support the observations above (used the % obtained from the activiy, number of drivers, fares and number of rides are any chosen numbers) -
